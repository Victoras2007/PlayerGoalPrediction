**Premier League Player Goal Prediction ⚽️**
---
**Target:**
The project aims to predict the number of goals a player will score in an upcoming match in the Premier League based on previous match statistics of that player.
>Knowing the predicted number of goals a player might score in an upcoming match is a useful insight for the scouting department of the team. >Also, knowing the goals that will be scored in an upcoming match by a player assists in setting up the starting XI and adjusting the tactics of >the match. Moreover, it can help manage the team's attacking players and help the scouting team make decisions on potential transfers. Lastly, it >will assist fans to bet on players scoring in upcoming matches.

**How our project works:**
We build the model using machine learning techniques and trained it on previous match statistics.

**Premier League Player Goal Prediction**
---
**Target:**
The project predicts the number of goals a player will score in an upcoming match in the Premier League based on various factors such as Expected goals(xG) and Minutes played.

**Purpose:**
Knowing the predicted number of goals a player might score in an upcoming match is a useful insight for the scouting department of the team. Also, knowing the goals that will be scored in an upcoming match by a player assists in setting up the starting XI and adjusting the tactics of the match. Moreover, it can help manage the team's attacking players and help the scouting team make decisions on potential transfers. Lastly, it will assist fans to bet on players scoring in upcoming matches.

**How our project works:**
We build the model using machine learning techniques and trained it on previous match statistics.

**Key features used:**
- Position of player
- Minutes played by player
- Goals scored in previous matches
- Total shots
- Total shots on target
- Penalty shots on goal
- Expected goals (xG)
- Goalkeeper saves (of opposing team)
- Goals conceded (by opposing team)
- Penalty kicks saved (by opposing team)
  


**Model:**
Model is trained using regression techniques and proper evaluating methods.

**Dataset:**
Used data from: Kaggle and FBref
